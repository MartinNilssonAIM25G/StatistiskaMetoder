# Statistical Methods – Linear Regression Assignment (OLS)

This repo contains my solution for the Statistical Methods assignment (OLS multiple linear regression).

The main implementation is in linear_regression.py and includes regression statistics such as RMSE, R², F-test, t-tests, p-values, confidence intervals, and Pearson correlation matrix.

The notebook assignment.ipynb demonstrates the functionality on the California Housing dataset (1997).
